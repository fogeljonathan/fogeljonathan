I’m @fogeljonathan, but my you can call me.. um... Jonathan Fogel...

I’m interested in physics, mathematical patterns, games, and playing music (including :guitar: :violin: :saxophone:)!

I love honing old skills and learning new ones, and I'm willing to collaborate on just about any project as a result.

If you need me, reach out to: fogeljonathan@gmail.com
