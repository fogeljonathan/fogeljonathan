  I’m @fogeljonathan, but you can call me Jon, Jonathan, J-Dawg, or whatever you like, really. I’m from the Philadelphia suburbs, but now live in Boston, MA. My hobbies include Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, solo indy game dev, gaming, camping, and playing :guitar: ... but that's probably not why you are here. My technical interests include Game Development in the Godot engine(and previously in Unity), simulations of game theory and physical systems, and Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS).
  <br><br>
  </b>I hold a Bachelor's degree from Franklin and Marshall College, where I double-majored in Physics and Mathematics.
  <br><br>
  </b>I have experience with many languages, including: Julia, Python, MATLAB, C++, C#, R, latex, and gdscript, and with tools such as git, Gitlab, Godot, and Unity.
